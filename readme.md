# AI Voice Chat

## Overview

This is a simple react app that allows you to chat with an AI assistant using your voice.

It uses `Whisper large v3` for transcription, `openchat 3.5 AWQ` for the AI assistant, and `XTTS v2` for text to speech.

Its main feature is speech to speech latency, it more than halves the latency of the ChatGPT with voice demo video.
